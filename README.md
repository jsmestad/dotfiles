dotfiles
========

Requirements
------------

Set `zsh` as your login shell:

    chsh -s $(which zsh)

Install
-------

Clone onto your laptop:

    git clone git://github.com/jsmestad/dotfiles.git

(Or, [fork and keep your fork
updated](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/keeping-a-github-fork-updated)).

Install [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm):

    brew bundle dotfiles/Brewfile

Install:

    rcup -d dotfiles -x README.md -x LICENSE -x Brewfile

This will create symlinks for config files in your home directory. The `-x`
options, which exclude the `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `Brewfile` files, are
needed during installation but can be skipped once the `.rcrc` configuration
file is symlinked in.

You can safely run `rcup` multiple times to update:

    rcup

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations in dotfiles appended with `.local`:

* `~/.aliases.local`
* `~/.antigenrc.local`
* `~/.gitconfig.local`
* `~/.gvimrc.local`
* `~/.tmux.conf.local`
* `~/.vimrc.local`
* `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`
* `~/.zshrc.local`

For example, your `~/.aliases.local` might look like this:

    # Productivity
    alias todo='$EDITOR ~/.todo'

Your `~/.antigenrc.local` might look like this:

    # Development Tools
    antigen bundle git-flow
    antigen bundle rbenv
    antigen bundle capistrano

    # ZSH Theme
    antigen theme murilasso

Your `~/.gitconfig.local` might look like this:

    [alias]
      l = log --pretty=colored
    [pretty]
      colored = format:%Cred%h%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)%an%Creset
    [user]
      name = Justin Smestad
      email = justin@overstuffedgorilla.com

Your `~/.zshrc.local` might look like this:

    # recommended by brew doctor
    export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"

Your `~/.vimrc.bundles.local` might look like this:

    Bundle 'Lokaltog/vim-powerline'
    Bundle 'stephenmckinney/vim-solarized-powerline'
